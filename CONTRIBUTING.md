# Contributing to PlanOut
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.  If you identify and bugs, have improvements to the code or documentation,
we will be happy to review your code and integrate the changes into the main
branch.

If you are planning on porting PlanOut to other languages or platforms,
please let us know! We are happy to review ports in detail, and either post
them on our own repository, or link to your own repository as a submodule.

## Code of Conduct
The code of conduct is described in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Our Development Process
The Python reference implementation mirrors the functionality of PlanOut and
core parts of Facebook's experimentation stack, which is written in Hack (we 
hope to open source parts of this implementation in the near future). As
we improve PlanOut internally, we will continue to maintain the Python
implementation as to maintain feature parity.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested (most code should be!), add unit tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
